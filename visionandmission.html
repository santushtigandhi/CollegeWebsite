Established as an institute of higher learning in 1964, RLA College embodies the ideal of a public funded higher educational institution with an emphasis on inclusivity, integration, quality and social equality.The College works with the motto "Shraddhawan Labhte Gyanam" which implies those earn knowledge who work for it with dedication.Traditionally, in our college mentoring of the students starts from the day of admission in college and goes on until much after their graduation. The experience and knowledge of the teachers instills values of honest behavior, planning for a holistic growth and aspiring for a clean and healthy future for one and all. In the times of cutthroat competition, we teach our students to look out for fellow humans, respect national unity and global harmony, learn new concepts quickly and effectively, and finally, to complete the cycle of give and take by reciprocating and returning to the world
